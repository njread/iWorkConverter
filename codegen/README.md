The .json files are from https://github.com/obriensp/iWorkFileFormat the original README appears below. I tweaked them to be valid json, ran `codegen` on them, and added the cleaned up output to the `index` package.



## Original Readme

These .json files were created from Keynote 6.0, Pages 5.0 and Numbers 3.0. They were created by attaching to the running applications using F-Script and evaluating this expression:

	> TSPRegistry sharedRegistry

The resulting output was then manually cleaned up and organized.
